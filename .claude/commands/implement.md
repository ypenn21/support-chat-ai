# Implement Feature

You are building a Chrome extension that provides AI-powered response suggestions for support agents.

**Project Context**: Read `.claude/docs/project-design.md`, `.claude/docs/tech-stack.md`, and `.claude/docs/project-context.md` for complete architecture and design details.

**Key Requirements**:
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow Manifest V3 standards
- Implement proper error handling
- Add appropriate types for all functions
- Follow the project structure defined in tech-stack.md
- Use the coding patterns from project-context.md

**Before implementing**:
1. Understand which component this belongs to (content script, background, popup, or backend)
2. Check existing code to maintain consistency
3. Consider platform-specific requirements (Coinbase, Robinhood, etc.)
4. Think about error cases and edge conditions

**After implementing**:
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- Add error handling
- Consider performance implications
- Test in actual Chrome environment

Now implement the requested feature following the project's architecture and patterns.
